# Matrix Multiply Android Example

This example demonstrates the use of Java eRPC for Android. It could be used with as a server or client. This example is
compatible with the Python, C or Java versions of this example.

When the client is started, it generates two random matrices and sends them to the server. The server then performs
matrix multiplication and sends the resulting matrix back to the client. The client then prints out the resulting
matrix.
